DE Notes.

1 Intially set up the project.
1.1 Create repo in github and pull down into project. Label “start” 
1.2 Create a working branch. Never work in master.
1.3 Create notes add git. Label “notes”.
1.4 Create a basic empty intellij project. Label “project start”
Ensure that the .gitignore is set up otherwise we will submit things that should not be submitted,
and spend the rest of the project trying delete. 
NOTE never submit passwords/public private keys or any other sensitive data to git. It is almost impossible to remove. Check and add files individually not as git add *. THINK BEFORE COMMIT.
