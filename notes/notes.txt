DE Notes.

1 Intially set up the project.
1.1 Create repo in github and pull down into project. Label “start” 
1.2 Create a working branch. Never work in master.
1.3 Create notes add git. Label “notes”.
1.4 Create a basic empty intellij project. Label “empty_project”
Ensure that the .gitignore is set up otherwise we will submit things that should not be submitted,
and spend the rest of the project trying delete. 
NOTE never submit passwords/public private keys or any other sensitive data to git. It is almost impossible to remove. Check and add files individually not as git add *. THINK BEFORE COMMIT.
1.4.1 Add in all the other bits that make up a project. Label "empty_part_one"

1.5 Lets create a simple project that runs and can be debugged.
1.6 create the tests we need to pass.
    Note
    1) Normally would create scalatest or some other framework with assertions but we will examine by eye.
    2) Going to use a reactive methodology rather than procedural (which is easy) and looks similar to functional code base.
    3) Had a test framwork that worked using virtual time, which is by far the best way of doing the testing, do not have this code at the moment with out
        reserrecting a dead computer that had water damage.

1.7) We have documented the tests. Write the code for part 1, visually examine the output. Label "end_part_one"
1.8)
